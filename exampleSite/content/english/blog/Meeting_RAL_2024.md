The third joint meeting for the XLZD consortium took place 15-19th of April 2024 at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, at Harwell in the UK. The detector design book and funding strategies were discussed in a wide forum. Excitement over the imminent formation of the future collaboration which will deliver this deffinitive instrument was also widespread.
